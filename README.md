# GTAIV-MP-Guide-for-Fort

**HELLO, DEAR FORTIANS)))) welcome**<br>
might post a MEGA link later to the entire game to skip all of this shit<br>
if you hate reading, there is a video guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AyFKKu1L_Y

<h1>THINGS TO DO BEFORE CONTINUING</h1>

**Launch the game atleast ONCE before proceeding!**

**Turning off your Anti-Virus during the whole process is mandatory, after excluding the game folder you can turn it back on again.**

Exclude your GTAIV folder through Windows Security and select the folder, otherwise Windows might delete some important files (such as zolikapatch.ini and GFWLDLC.asi).

<h2>IF YOU OWN THE STEAM VERSION</h2>
When you're done downloading the game, make sure the folder name is "GTAIV", otherwise the downgrade won't work.

<h1>STEP 1. DLCs</h1>

Go to your "GTAIV" folder and make a new folder named "DLC" as shown in the screenshot.

Now you need to move your "TLAD" and "TBoGT" folders from the "GTAIV" directory to your newly created "DLC" folder, after this your "DLC" folder should look like what's shown below.

Go to any DLC folder and make a new folder inside of them called "content", move every DLC file to the "content" folder, do the same for BOTH.
End result:<br>

You are set for downgrading.

<h1>STEP 2. DOWNGRADING</h1>

You can choose between version 1.0.7.0 and 1.0.8.0, personally I went for 8.
To get the required files download them from this MEGA link: https://mega.nz/file/Gx5WjC6B#nFe8W8W_eC_mN0ND7UfyTbgpfX6RmX_fIZEFiz403yc
DO NOT FORGET TO TURN OFF YOUR ANTI-VIRUS!<br>
The downloaded .zip will look like this:<br>

<br>You can downgrade by using the provided .bat or by dragging the files manually from the "files_for_bat" folder.
<h3>If you're downgrading manually</h3>
Copy everything from the "8" folder (or "7", depends on you) and paste the files into your "GTAIV" folder, overwrite if asked, do the same for "shared/install".<br>
<br>After moving the files you're now supposed to install GFWL (Games for Windows Live), the installation .exe is found in the same .zip you got your downgrade files, it is located in the "shared" folder.<br>
<br>Your installation might fail, if that happens download the required GFWL files from this MEGA link: https://mega.nz/file/fcxUWCoD#NhrpBveqbhmxAxFd009dUk2G8S90w8FqShXv56CY2Bo<br>
put the downloaded GFWL files to "Windows/SysWOW64".<br><br>
Do not forget to install MS Visual 2005 Runtime Libraries, the installation .exe is located in the "files_for_bat" folder.

<h1>STEP 3. Games for Windows Live (fuck this shit)</h1>

To get multiplayer and DLCs working, you need to have an Outlook account that is not **>3 years old** and an Xbox Live account (Xbox account basically), if your Outlook account is old, you won't be able to login to GFWL.<br>

If you cannot login with your old Outlook account, just make a new one, and don't forget to make an Xbox Live account as well.<br>

You can now launch the game from the "GTAIV" folder by clicking "PlayGTAIV.exe", during loading you should see a GFWL pop-up, push HOME on your keyboard.<br>

Login with your newly created or old Outlook account, if login is successfull (correct password and email) you will be on the "Please wait..." screen which will take 10 minutes or less to complete logging you in, this long wait time is only for first time login.<br>
After the "Please wait..." screen you will have to input a serial key for the game, now for this step please contact Valacdi#2472 to get the required serial key to proceed.<br>

After inputting the serial key you might get an error, try logging in again if that happens.<br><br>
If you see your GFWL profile after all of this, you are set and can play multiplayer by pulling out your phone ingame and selecting "Play Multiplayer" -> "LIVE".

<h1>SOME THINGS YOU COULD DO TO IMPROVE THE GAME</h1>
If I recall correctly R* has cut some songs from the radio stations, to get the old songs back you can download them from here: https://gtaforums.com/topic/936600-iii-iv-various-gta-downgraders/<br>
GTA IV has no Anti-Aliasing, if you would like to have some sort of AA, you can inject SMAA, download link: https://gtaforums.com/topic/508407-inject-smaa-antialiasing/<br>
GTA IV has no Anti-Cheat, so you can cheat and no one would give a shit. Download Zolika's trainer as it can be useful for some fun multiplayer sessions: https://gtaforums.com/topic/896795-1000-1080-zolika1351s-trainermod-menu-rewritten/
